This demo enables cooperative drawing from html5 capable browser clients.
It allows CRUD operations for drawings using JAX-RS and SSE (implemented by Jersey) 
and simultaneous changes of the same drawing using WebSocket (implemented by Tyrus).
The server side demos Jersey and Tyrus integration on top of Grizzly.

To build the demo, run: mvn package
To run the demo, run: java -jar target\drawingboard-light-ijug-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar
and then go to http://localhost:8080/drawingboard/ in a browser
